    "We wish to estimate the surprise number (2nd moment) of a data stream, using the method of AMS. It happens that our stream consists of ten different values, which we'll call 1, 2,..., 10, that cycle repeatedly. That is, at timestamps 1 through 10, the element of the stream equals the timestamp, at timestamps 11 through 20, the element is the timestamp minus 10, and so on. It is now timestamp 75, and a 5 has just been read from the stream. As a start, you should calculate the surprise number for this time.\n",

    "For our estimate of the surprise number, we shall choose three timestamps at random, and estimate the surprise number from each, using the AMS approach (length of the stream times 2m-1, where m is the number of occurrences of the element of the stream at that timestamp, considering all times from that timestamp on, to the current time). Then, our estimate will be the median of the three resulting values.\n",

    "We wish to use the Flagolet-Martin lgorithm to count the number of distinct elements in a stream. Suppose that there ten possible elements, 1, 2,..., 10, that could appear in the stream, but only four of them have actually appeared. To make our estimate of the count of distinct elements, we hash each element to a 4-bit binary number. The element x is hashed to 3x + 7 (modulo 11). For example, element 8 hashes to 3x8+7 = 31, which is 9 modulo 11 (i.e., the remainder of 31/11 is 9). Thus, the 4-bit string for element 8 is 1001.\n",

Then, identify the set of four elements that gives the exactly correct estimate from {3, 4, 8, 10}, {1, 2, 3, 9}, {4, 5, 6, 7}, { 3, 7, 8, 10}."
